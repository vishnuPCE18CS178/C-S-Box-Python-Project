# C-S-Box-Python-Project

This Project is based upon Python's Socket Programming and can work as Chat Box in Queue Format.

STEPS TO EXECUTE:
------------------

->  run both files in separate Terminal.
    (One for Sender & another for Reciever)

->  first enter PORT NUMBER in schat.py running terminal & same PORT NO in rchat.py running terminal also.

->  start texting/sending texts first from schat.py running terminal and then from another one.

    text one by one and you will see the pattern.
